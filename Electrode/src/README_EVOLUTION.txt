EVOLUTION STRATEGY




WE will evolve to use the Electrode_Integrator class as the base class for the integration routines.


We will carry this out by evolving the child classes to the common look and feel provided in the 
Electrode_Integrator class. Then, when we finally insert the Electrode_Integrator class in the
stack of the child classes, it will be a minor update instead of a major update.

This is a very simple test that prints out a lot of output.

It's meant to test the Transfer of NonlinearSolver to a JacobianManager formulation

It actually prints out the Numerical jacobian to stdout. It's expected that the nonlinear
iteration behavior and the Numerical jacobian will stay constant as a function of time.

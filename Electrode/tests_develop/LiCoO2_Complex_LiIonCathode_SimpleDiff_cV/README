LiCoO2_Complex_LiIonCathode_SimpleDiff_cV 

This directory is a test directory that is meant to understand how to get the Redlich Kister CoO2 model up and
going. Right now the model doesn't work. 

The file getActivityCoefficients gets called during the Electrode_SimpleDiff initialization phase. I 
have assumed previously that the activity coefficient is always to be collected from the ThermoPhase object.
This creates a dump in this case, because I have new Cantera code that creates a valid Throw in this case.


Procedure: GibbsExcessVPSSTP::getActivityCoefficients() 
Error:     activity coefficient is overflowing 




The program LiCoO2_Thermo has shown that the computation of the log 
of the activity coefficient is stable, giving accurate values even 
though the activity coefficient is not machine representable.


At no point does the thermodynamics code calculate the activity coefficients directly.


However, the kinetics code does use the concentration activity coefficient

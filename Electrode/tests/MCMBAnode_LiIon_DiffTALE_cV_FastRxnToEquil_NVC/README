HKM

This is a test with a fast reaction that reaches equilibrium.


It starts off with a constant voltage drain of the electrode. The voltage is at 0.2 volts.
The open circuit voltage of the initial electrode is at -0.023098 volts. At the end,
electrode has an open circuit voltage of 0.2 volts.


The time steps start off with an initial value of
 2.5E-4
It fails the p-c at that time step, but passes at deltaT = 6.25 E-5.
Even at that time step there is an appreciable change in the outer radial concentration. 
The vacency concentration changed from 0.2  to 0.33879.
So that is quite acceptable. the p-c value was 139.6


The predictor-corrector is only respondent to the species concentration unknown. All the rest
are totally zero.

The solution is highly kinetic. Diffusion can't keep up. So, a quasi-equilibrium is formed at
the boundary of the particle. this occurs at roughly a time constant of 4E-3. Then, the open circuit
voltage of the electrode is 0.16 volts. The vacancy concentration is 0.943 at the surface, and 0.202 
within the center of the particle at that time.
The particle then proceeds to drain via a diffusion time scale.

The deltaT got stuck at 1.0E-4 during this draining. I think this may be an issue. This may mean I have
to treat the reactions at the surface in a quasi-implicit manner during the predictor. This was discussed
by Hewson and Moffat.

The outer loop is set at 0.1 deltaT. This is far too much. The subintegrations necessary to attain that
are 1159 times. By that time the particle is at least half drained by diffusion.

The electrode is pretty much drained by 0.4 seconds, taking 3500 subgrid steps. Only then does the time
step go beyond 1.0E-4.


The predictor overpredicts the vacancy concentration at the surface. This would be remedied by an implicit
treatment of the surface reaction.

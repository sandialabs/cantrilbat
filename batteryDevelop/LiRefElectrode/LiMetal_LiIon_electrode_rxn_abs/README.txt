This is an example of the methodology to allow the reference electrode's Ess to vary
with the temperature.

This is written up elsewhere, but the basic idea is that delta S for all species including ions
and electrons are modeled via constitutive laws. Then, Ess for 298 is adjusted to zero by setting the heat of formation
of the electron in the reference state metal. 

In addition we've set the Heat of formation of the reference state ion in the solution, Li+ in this case, to zero.
However, we must come up with the absolute entropy of the ion in solution. Here, we've made a wild ass guess at the
answer.

  *    Returns system cpu and wall clock time in seconds. This
  *    is a strictly Ansi C timer, since clock() is defined as an
  *    Ansi C function. On some machines clock() returns type
  *    unsigned long (HP) and on others (SUN) it returns type long.
  *       An attempt to recover the actual time for clocks which have
  *    rolled over is made also. However, it only works if this 
  *    function is called fairly regularily during
  *    the solution procedure.
  *
  *    clock() -> returns the time in microseconds. Division by
  *               the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC recovers the time in seconds.

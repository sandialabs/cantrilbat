doxygen usage.


   It seems that the recent doxygen doesn't like *'s at the start of
comment lines. It get's confused when I added a \verbatim section to
the .h group files. Not sure how to fix this other than to take the
*'s out.



Proper use of TAGFILES:  the = argment must point to the html output of
              the external doxygen documentation. for example:



UTPUT_DIRECTORY  = proj
INPUT             = proj/src
TAGFILES          = ext1/ext1.tag=../../ext1/html \
                    ext2/ext2.tag=../../ext2/html 

where 

    root>
      +- proj
      |   +- html               HTML output directory for proj
      |   +- src                sources for proj
      |   |- proj.cpp
      +- ext1
      |   +- html               HTML output directory for ext1
      |   |- ext1.tag           tag file for ext1
      +- ext2
      |   +- html               HTML output directory for ext2
      |   |- ext2.tag           tag file for ext2
      |- proj.cfg               doxygen configuration file for proj
      |- ext1.cfg               doxygen configuration file for ext1
      |- ext2.cfg               doxygen configuration file for ext2

Verified that this works.

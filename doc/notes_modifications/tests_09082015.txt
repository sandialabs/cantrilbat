Issue #          note-1
Name             Harry Moffat
Concept          Test suite
Date             090715
Files            Electrode test suite
Functions       

Bug Issues       All tests should look  alike. There may be significant issues with users if this is not the case.
                 Also, it will help the automatic running of the suite.

motivation       Ease of use
                 If and when I go to cmake, I'll need a uniform standard.
                 CTest relies on the executable that is called returning 0 for
                 pass and 1 for a failure.  I think this is the standard.
                 I want an automatic way to count the number of passed and failed tests 


Example

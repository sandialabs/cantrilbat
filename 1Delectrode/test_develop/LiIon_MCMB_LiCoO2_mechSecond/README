 Simple test problem for mechanics. Here the molar volumes in  MCMB_RedlichKister.xml   and     LiCoO2_Margules_1.xml   
are modified so that volume expansion will occur. Therefore, there is volume expansion during reaction on both the
cathode and the anode.


This is an isothermal problem.

  Noticed that it runs until there is an umfpack assertion of singular matrix

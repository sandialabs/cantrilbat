 Simple test problem for mechanics. Here the molar volumes in  MCMB_RedlichKister.xml   and     LiCoO2_Margules_1.xml   
are modified so that volume expansion will occur. Therefore, there is volume expansion during reaction on both the
cathode and the anode.

This is a non-isothermal problem. A temperature ramp is imposed on the battery.

  Noticed that it fails with an umfpack assert of a singular matrix

Simple test problem designed with Dirichelet boundary conditions between 302 and 298.
A temperature ramp is the expected solution.


This is a first problem that uses the temperature equation, as opposed to the enthalpy equation.
Note there is a strict way to go from one to the other, that is correct up to round-off error,
i.e., it's better than discretization error and only differs based on the accuracy of the solution.

Currently, this is unimplemented and will give an error.

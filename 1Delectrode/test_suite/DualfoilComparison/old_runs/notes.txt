Run 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This was taken with a A cathode reaction of 5.0E7.  this produced 3.77 ocv and 3.66 volts at the end of 3600. seconds.

The dualfoil base calculation was 3.73 and 3.65.

Most of the overpotential was in the positive cathode 0.07 vs. 0.035 volts.


Run 2
----------------------------------------------------------

In run2 I increased the A cathode reaction to 5.0E8. The idea was to 
fit the calculations to the dualfoil result.

The end result was better. However, I noticed a large problem with the anode
capacity. I changed   MCMBAnode_electrode.xml  molar volume and ran it again.

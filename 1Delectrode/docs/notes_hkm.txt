Notes on what I see 1/20/2011
-----------------------------

I noticed that in the beginning of the calculation (infPorous) the
electrode actually goes backwards in the anode at the back of the
anode. I'm not sure how this is done as I don't think there is any
room for the electrons in the solid. This is probably an artificial
result due to some sort of numerical roundoff.

The infPorous run I'm taking as still good. It actually uses the base
class of electrode and uses a different call to get the species
reaction rates than the other methods.

My first thought is to get the Porous example problem producing about
the same results as the infPorous results. this is what I'm going
after first. Currently the production rates from the Porous flow
example runs at an unphysical 1.1 volts and productes 8 amps cm^-2
current.
This is in contrast to the 10^3 amps cm-2 at 1.9 volts for the
infPorous flow case. Therefore, the results are totally different.

I think the differences are due to the change in the surface area
between the two cases. I have previously made sure that the two
methods produced the same result. I'm going to revisit this work and
see if I can get it to work again.


In order to carry this out, I'll be adding more output to
showSolution() to make sure that the two calculations are doing the
same thing

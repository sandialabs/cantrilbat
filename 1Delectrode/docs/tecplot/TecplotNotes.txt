---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Start tecplot
   
Use the tecplot reader to read in one bulkdomain data file. The other data files can be read in later.


Right now each zone is a different time slice

Mapping Style -> The choice of what variables to be plotted is made here.

   You can create a map num for each time in your data set for one variable
You can create a map num for each time in your data set for one variable. You
do this with the "CreateMap" command at the bottom of MappingStyle.
Then, you can select which ones will individually appear on the plot


View command
    fit to screen is useful.


Axis command
       Change plot exes and titles
  Use the line command to create a grid border.


To Export a Plot
     export MWF formatted data.


To Compare data Y2 axis - setup 
    makes a double- y plot


To add subscripts and superscripts and greek
     use <sub>   </sub>
         <sup>   </sup>
         <greek> </greek>


Broken:  The time dial on the left seems to be broken. It doesn't actually change the data that you are looking at. You need to go into
  MappingStyle and change the zone in order to change the time


To bring in more than one zone, you need to add the data sets after you have
created the map num's.   Then they will be duplicated. Then, you have to go
through the map num's and select them individually for plotting. Yes, this is
arduous.

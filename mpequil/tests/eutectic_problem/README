This is an example where the gibbs free energy change for removal of the phase, starts to get vanishingly low. This causes an inordinate number of iterations in the algorithm.

The "better" solutions are from the new capability to check the stability of existing phases and do large jumps. 
This capability is in the liquidTransportBranch and will be ported over.

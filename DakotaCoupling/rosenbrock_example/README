  Simple  example problem from Dakota's user manual to get me going


   Conclusions


      The biggest thing I found out was that the example problem had some severe problems with locating executables
and directories. However, I did finally figure it out.

      You must put the absolute path names of the executable and the template directory in dakota's input file.
So far I have not found a way to remove this restriction. The problem seems to be that the executable is invoked
from multiple directories. (2 below the current one and the current dir). There doesn't seem to be any other
way other than to put the working directory in your path, which accomplishes the same thing.

The executable is executed 2 directories below the current one, always. Therefore, one may use that to find executables
in the current directory.



   Reading Chapter 13 in the manual indicates where the problem may lie. The manual says that it fixes the problem.
However, the fix is to alter the PATH variable before handing back control to the user. I know that I completely
remake the PATH variable in my .cshrc file. Therefore, the fix would be lost in my particular case, which
isn't so particular.

# Taken from Bensen's book. 
# However, entropy is negative; this is not correct.
# Group contribution approach needs to be modified. Bensen has a
# negative value for S here, because the group contribution is usually
# lumped in with other groups which have positive S contributions.
# However, for the current mechanism, bulk thermodynamics doesn't
# matter since all reactions involving bulk growth or etching
# are irreversible.

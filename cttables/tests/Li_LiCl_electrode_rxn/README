Liquid Li electrode reaction:


The main reason for this directory has turned into making and verifying the
electron thermodynamics file, metal_Li_LiCl_electrons.xml.


We have specified that the electron chemical potential should be set so that
the reaction, 

   Li (l)   ->   Li(+)  +  e-  

should have an E of zero.  This directory creats the e- file and confirms
the calculation.

There are a couple of notes however,   Li(+) is specific to a single salt LiCl.
E0 is not exactly zero, because the mole fraction of Li(+) in the single 
salt is 0.5. This causes a Rln(2.0) modification to the entropy of the
electron to be added in so that the value of E for the reaction above
in a pure LiCl solution is equal to zero for all relevant temperatures.

This calculation is dependent on the shomate polynomial for Li(l) and
LiCl(l), which are obtained from NIST's webbook.

It also turns out that we need to supply a molar volume for e- just to fill
out the ThermoPhase specification. I've set this to an extremely high quantity.
Hopefully, it won't ever come into play.

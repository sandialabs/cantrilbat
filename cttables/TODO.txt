Some type of ordering control is necessary. I need to specify that 
this block needs to succeed a set of blocks or line entries or else
an error condition ensues.

The ordering must be consistent with the order of the arrays that
hold the line entries and blocks within each block object. 

This would argue for a way to order the line Entries and blocks
amongst each other. One could do that by making a combined
parent class common to both of them and then using a single
array to hold both classees.

The ordering must also use specific information about relationships
In other words, this block can't occur before this line entry as
information from the line entry is need in the setup of the block.

Also, a common occurance is that a line entry will make possible
or necessary the imposition of other line entries or blocks. Or,
it will at least specify how many are needed. Thus a way to 
dynamically change the block structure on the fly is needed.
I think this is possible by creating line entries and block
structures from within other line entries and block structures.
However, this concept needs to be fleshed out some more.

cttables Projects
-------------------------------

1) Add in support for selective processing of tables just as in surftherm.

2) Add in a summary table for the Thermo of all reactions in the mechanism.

3) Formalize the decision making as to whether to turn on output of the
   command file read process -> link it to the debug command.

4) Add in a formal way to print out the command file options.

5) Add in a way to process xml files that don't have the transport data.

This is a repository for mechanisms and transport data for liquid phase
applications based on Cantera.

All data in this folder should be be referenced to original pubs for
lookup and validation.

Then, copies of the files in the directories should be used in application
folders. The original ID data from this directory should be retained for
reference purposes in the copied files. If folders are also under
the CVS system this will entail commenting out the original keywords
to retain the version data.

Example:
Original cvs info data:

       $Id: README,v 1.1 2006/01/16 17:30:22 hkmoffa Exp $

New  cvs data in an application directory

       Original ID from cvs mechanism directory:
           HMW_NaCl.xml,v 1.2 2006/01/16 17:20:19 hkmoffa Exp
       Application cvs ID information:
           $Id: README,v 1.1 2006/01/16 17:30:22 hkmoffa Exp $
